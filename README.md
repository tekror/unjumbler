# Unjumbler

### This program has two major functions:
#### - Showing all words that can be made from the exact letters entered
#### - Showing all possible words that can be made from any given variation of the letters entered


### How does it work?
#### A Node.js Express server is used to host a JSON file that holds every known English word
#### The main HTML page takes in user input and provides a response based on the radio button selected

#### To run the code, simply run the nodeserver.js file through Node and connect the browser to http://localhost:8080/unjumbler.html
